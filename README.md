# c_snhu_CS210
Project 3

-This project was the final project for SNHU CS 210. The point of the project was to allow the user to type in a grocery item and the program would tell you how many times the item is on the provided list of grocery items. It can also provide you a written number for all of your searches on the list or a histogram of the items that you searched for.  

-Overall the program works very well with little issues. The search function works very well with not coming up with errors. It also has no issues saving your searches to a .dat file after the program is closed.  

-Where the code could be enhanced is it is case sensitive. All the items on the list have the first letter capitalized but that was not clear when prompted to search for an item. I would improve it by allowing it to search for any item with any case.  

-The most challenging to write was the search function because it required opening a file searching the file and then closing the file. In order to do this I had to include loops and counters so it would run smoothly.  

-I believe the skills this project enhanced was being able to take an idea and code it into a workable project that can be used by the customer. It also required a good structure for the code so it could be easy to be read.  

-In order to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I would add another function to the menu to allow the user to add items to the list so as the store acquires more items it will be tracked and can be searched for. I would also add a function to remove items from the list so as items sold or expired they could be removed.
